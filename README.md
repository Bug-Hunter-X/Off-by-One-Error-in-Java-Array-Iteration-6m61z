This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in Java: the off-by-one error.  The provided `bug.java` file contains code that attempts to sum the elements of an integer array. However, due to an error in the loop condition, it attempts to access an index beyond the bounds of the array, resulting in an `ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException`. The `bugSolution.java` file shows the corrected code. This example highlights the importance of careful loop condition design to avoid such runtime exceptions.
